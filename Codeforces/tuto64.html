            <h2>Hi,Thanks for visiting my site.</h2>
            <p>
              Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself.
              Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know
              yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me
              give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my
              self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your
              impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There
              are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to
              read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to
              talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning,
              I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music
              flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the
              ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind,
              I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle
              of the night. I like flowers in spring. I like to sleep early, I
              like to get up late; . I like delicious food and comfortable
              shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and
              the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
